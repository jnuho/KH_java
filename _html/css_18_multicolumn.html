        Marshall, sounds like an S.O.S.
        Holy whack unlyrical lyrics Andre, you're fuckin' right!
        To the rap mobile, let's go!
        Marshall! Marshall!
        Bitches and Gentleman!
        It's showtime!
        Hurry, hurry, step right up!
        Introducin' the star of our show, his name is
        Marshall!
        You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
        So without further ado, I bring to you
        Marshall!
        You 'bout to witness hip hop in its
        Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless
        Most hardest, most honest, known artist
        Chip off the old block but old doc is
        Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
        Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden

        <div class="col">
            With his own private plane, his own pilot
            Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)
            Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
            Yeah, here I come
            I'm inches away from you, here, fear none
            Hip hop is in a state of 911, so
            Let's get down to business
            I don't got no time to play around what is this?
            Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
            On these clowns, can I get a witness?
            Hell Yeah!
